The PageRank algorithm is used to designate every aspect of a set of hyperlinked documents with a numerical weighting. It is used by the Google search engine to estimate the relative importance of a web page according to this weighting. The system uses probability distribution to determine the odds that a person randomly clicking on links will arrive at any given page. Following this, each web page is given a ranking of 0-10 according to its relevance to a search. The PageRank is calculated by taking into consideration the number of inbound links, and the PageRank of the pages supplying these links. This means therefore that if a webpage is linked to others that have a high ranking, then it too will receive a high rank. 

Due to the nature of the PageRank system, it is susceptible to manipulation and has been exploited so that certain pages are given a false, exaggerated ranking. In these cases, only Goggle has access to the genuine PageRank. However, much research has been conducted into methods of avoiding links from documents with a false PageRank to try and iron out the bugs in this system and from 2007 Google has actively penalized schemes which try to increase rankings artificially.
The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.
Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.
Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.
