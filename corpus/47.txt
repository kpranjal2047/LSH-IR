The first thing to consider when talking about Googleâ€™s PageRank algorithm, is that a PageRank is essentially how important that web page is to the internet. So in essence it is a popularity contest between WebPages.

Originally search engines used highest keyword density, however this could be abused if keyword spamming was implemented. Instead Google uses a system that is based on sites linking to each other, e.g. the more important a site is that is linked to yours the higher your site will become. 

The algorithm Google actually users is based on 4 factors, total number of pages, dampening factor, PageRank of a single page and the number of outbound links. A dampening factor is used to counter random surfers, who get bored and then switch to other pages. This formula is then re-used until the results seem to converge together, to find the PageRank, so it is calculated iteratively.

PageRank is used by Google to measure a popularity of the site and a number between 0-10 is assigned to each webpage depending on their PageRank. This allows Google to calculate a marketing value for different WebPages.

Also it should be noted that the PageRank is periodically updated every 3 to 6 months, this is counter hackers influence on different PageRanks.

The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.

Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.

Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.
