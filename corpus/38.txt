Within Information Retrieval each document in a set can be represented as a point in high-dimensional vector space, this representation is called the vector space model. Information Retrieval queries are also represented as vectors in the same vector space; these are then used in conjunction with the document vectors to find relevant documents. The two vectors are compared and the documents with a higher document-query similarity are ranked higher in terms of relevance. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to compare the two vectors; the most frequently used method for the vector space model is the Cosine Coefficient, which calculates the angle between the two vectors and produces a value between 0 and 1. 

Vector space model (or term vector model) is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval System.

A document is represented as a vector. Each dimension corresponds to a separate term.

If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting (see the example below).

The definition of term depends on the application.
