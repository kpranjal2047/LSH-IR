The PageRank is a recursive algorithm used by Google to determine which webpages are more important than others. The algorithm considers the importance of a webpage to be reflected by how many other webpages link to that page, and the importance of those pages.

For each page that links to a page A, the PageRank between zero and one is calculated iteratively according to the following two key factors: The probability of a user navigating away from a page randomly; the PageRank of any page that links to A, divided by the total number of outbound links from that page. This assumes that a link among many outbound links is less valuable than a link among fewer outbound links. A variation of the PageRank method bases the importance of a webpage on how many visits the page gets. 

The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site's PageRank. However, it is still a good indicator for search engines to use as a variable in deciding on the most appropriate results according to a query. 
The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.
Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.
Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.
