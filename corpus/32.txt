A website’s page rank, is how ‘important’ it is on the web.  It is essentially a popularity meter.  Popularity or importance is determined by the amount of links relating to the page there are, there are four different types.  Inbound, links from other pages to yours.  Outbound, links from your page to others.  Dangling, links to a page which has no links to others.  Deep, links to a specific page, usually bypassing the homepage.  The page rank algorithm takes the probability of a ‘random surfer’ becoming bored and requesting another ‘random page’ (otherwise known as the dampening factor) away from 1 and divides this number by the number of pages in the system, adding it to the dampening factor multiplied by the page rank of a linked page divided by the number of outbound links on that linked page.  Adding on this last section for every other page linked to from the original page.  Google uses this algorithm to assist intentional surfers in finding the best websites to suit their needs.  One of the problems with this popularity algorithm is that it is easily manipulated and can give false values, hence the frequent recalculating of page ranks.
The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.
Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.
Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.
