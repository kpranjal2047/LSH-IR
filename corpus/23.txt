The representation of a set of documents as vectors in a common vector space is known as the vector space vector space model and is fundamental to a host of information retrieval (IR) operations including scoring documents on a query, document classification, and document clustering.We first develop the basic ideas underlying vector space scoring; a pivotal step in this development is the view of queries as vectors in the same vector space as the document collection. 
Vector space model (or term vector model) is an algebraic model for representing text documents (and any objects, in general) as vectors of identifiers, such as, for example, index terms. It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings. Its first use was in the SMART Information Retrieval System.
A document is represented as a vector. Each dimension corresponds to a separate term. If a term occurs in the document, its value in the vector is non-zero. Several different ways of computing these values, also known as (term) weights, have been developed. One of the best known schemes is tf-idf weighting (see the example below).
The definition of term depends on the application.
