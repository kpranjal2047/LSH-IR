Page rank algorithm is used to determine a webpage’s importance or relevance in the web dependant on certain criteria. The criteria may include numbers of word matches with the search terms, number of other webpages that link this one and/or cite it as a source, number of unique visits for certain amount of time etc. There are some techniques that try to fool the search engines like link farms, keyword spamming and a lot of meta tags. The last two are somewhat easier to be dealt with (simply by being ignored most of the time). Link farms are groups of sites that are producing links between each other pursuing higher link counts. The reason for such manipulations is the pursuit of higher page rank so even higher number of users will see the page which will lead to higher income. Link farms can be exploited by joining to them and get inbound linkage but refuse to add links for one’s own site to the sites from the link farm. Google’s toolbar tries to follow the intentional user model by counting the visits from actual users (i.e. not computer bots) to a website. Page ranks can be calculated either recursively or iteratively. One of the most important uses of page rank is its meaning to advertising.
The PageRank is derived from a theoretical probability value on a logarithmic scale like the Richter Scale. The PageRank of a particular page is roughly based upon the quantity of inbound links as well as the PageRank of the pages providing the links. It is known that other factors, e.g. relevance of search words on the page and actual visits to the page reported by the Google toolbar also influence the PageRank. In order to prevent manipulation, spoofing and Spamdexing, Google provides no specific details about how other factors influence PageRank.
Numerous academic papers concerning PageRank have been published since Page and Brin's original paper. In practice, the PageRank concept has proven to be vulnerable to manipulation, and extensive research has been devoted to identifying falsely inflated PageRank and ways to ignore links from documents with falsely inflated PageRank.
Other link-based ranking algorithms for Web pages include the HITS algorithm invented by Jon Kleinberg (used by Teoma and now Ask.com), the IBM CLEVER project, and the TrustRank algorithm.
